SimpleDomain is my approach to write a consistent library which covers aspects of Domain Driven Design, CQRS and EventSourcing. It's highly influenced by the follwowing resources:

- [Greg Young: 8 lines of code](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/8-lines-code-refactoring)
- [CommonDomain](https://github.com/NEventStore/CommonDomain)
